## Why @derxjs

### Domain-agnostic state-management

Your state management code should not depend on which framework or tools your project happens to be using at the time.

`@derxjs/view-model` is all about first-principles thinking and problem-solving. The pattern enforced by this package requires you to break down your system - regardless of scope - to some set of inputs (preferably represented as RxJS Observables!) and expose a single Observable of your ViewModel as an output.

Future packages on the roadmap will provide utilities for implementing this pattern (`@derxjs/reducer` ðŸ‘€), as well as utilities for plugging it into popular front-end frameworks (`@derxjs/react` ðŸ‘€).

### Separation of concerns

We solved this a long time ago. Programming to interfaces lets us put a joint in our workflow that allows for parallel work to be completed by multiple developers and lets your team play to their strengths.

</p>

This allows for easy transitions into other implementations, frameworks, as well as implementing the facade, adapter, and proxy patterns from the Gang of Four.

### Complimentary to all existing state-management libraries

We're not here to take a shot at the king ([ðŸ‘‘](https://ngrx.io/)ðŸ‘€) - we're just here to help out where we can!

The `@derxjs/view-model` package is designed to work with any other state management frameworks that can expose state or events as an Observable, making it a great compliment to any existing code in your codebase.

### Future-Proof Code

Domain-agnostic first-principles-based code will never go out of style ðŸŒ².

As long as JavaScript is the language of the web, your state-management code will be valid.

Go ahead, change to that trendy new framework. Your @derxjs code will still work just fine :).

### Simplicity && Elegence

The `DeRxJSViewModel` type is the `E = mc^2` of state management.

Deceptively simple, but elegant enough to encompass any && all of your state management requirements.

### TDD made awesome with timeline testing

Embrace TDD, using timeline testing to test your code with a whole new dimension of precision.

On the roadmap for `@derxjs` is a timeline test generation GUI tool that will take your Typescript interface code, and allow you to "draw" hypothetical timelines of events from your inputs - specifying what the output timeline for each hypothetical should look like.

This tool will generate `.spec.ts` files that you can paste directly into your repos for easy TDD, and coding the way we were meant to.
